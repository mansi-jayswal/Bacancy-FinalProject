To begin with, you need to prepare the sugar syrup of one string consistency. Then, take a large wide bowl and add solidified ghee in it. Take one ice cube at a time and rub the ghee vigorously. Take more ice cubes as required till the ghee becomes very white in colour.\nStep 2 Prepare the Ghevar batter\nThen add milk, flour and one cup water. Mix these ingredients to make a smooth batter. Dissolve food colour in water and add to the batter. Add more water as required. The consistency of the batter should be fairly thin.\nStep 3 Cook the Ghevar\nThen take an aluminium or steel cylindrical container. Make sure that its height is at least 12″ and diameter is of 5-6″. Fill half of the container with ghee. Heat it and once the ghee is hot enough, then take a 50 ml, a glassful of the batter. Pour in centre of ghee, slowly in one continuous thread-like stream. Allow the foam to settle.\nStep 4 Cool the Ghevar and garnish with dry fruits\nAlternatively, pour some syrup evenly all over, keeping Ghevar in a mesh placed over a container. Let it cool and settle down, then top it with edible silver foil. Splash a few drops of saffron milk, sprinkle some chopped dry fruits and 1 tsp of cardamom powder. Serve it with savouries like Pakoras, Kachoris and Samosas.",

The quantity of milk depends on the amount of carrots you have, but a good rule of thumb is to add enough milk to just cover the carrots.\nLet the mixture simmer on low heat, stirring occasionally. Allow the carrots to cook in the milk until the milk reduces and thickens. This process could take around 30-40 minutes.\nStep 3: Sweeten and Flavor\n\nOnce the milk has reduced significantly and the carrots are cooked through, add sugar according to your taste preference. You can start with half a cup of sugar and adjust according to your sweetness preference.\nAdd cardamom powder and chopped nuts like almonds and pistachios for flavor and texture.\nStir well and continue cooking for another 10-15 minutes until the mixture thickens further and attains a halwa-like consistency.\nYour Gajar ka Halwa is now ready to be served hot or cold, garnished with more chopped nuts if desired.\nEnjoy your delicious homemade Gajar ka Halwa!",

This might take around 10-15 minutes on medium heat.\nStep 2: Cook the Carrots\n\nOnce the carrots are soft, add milk to the pan. The quantity of milk depends on the amount of carrots you have, but a good rule of thumb is to add enough milk to just cover the carrots.\nLet the mixture simmer on low heat, stirring occasionally. Allow the carrots to cook in the milk until the milk reduces and thickens. This process could take around 30-40 minutes.\nStep 3: Sweeten and Flavor\n\nOnce the milk has reduced significantly and the carrots are cooked through, add sugar according to your taste preference. You can start with half a cup of sugar and adjust according to your sweetness preference.\nAdd cardamom powder and chopped nuts like almonds and pistachios for flavor and texture.\nStir well and continue cooking for another 10-15 minutes until the mixture thickens further and attains a halwa-like consistency.\nYour Gajar ka Halwa is now ready to be served hot or cold, garnished with more chopped nuts if desired.\nEnjoy your delicious homemade Gajar ka Halwa!",

      "method": "Step 1 Prepare the sugar syrup for Ghevar\nGhevar is an easy-to-make recipe and can be prepared with some easily available ingredients. To begin with, you need to prepare the sugar syrup of one string consistency. Then, take a large wide bowl and add solidified ghee in it. Take one ice cube at a time and rub the ghee vigorously. Take more ice cubes as required till the ghee becomes very white in colour.\nStep 2 Prepare the Ghevar batter\nThen add milk, flour and one cup water. Mix these ingredients to make a smooth batter. Dissolve food colour in water and add to the batter. Add more water as required. The consistency of the batter should be fairly thin.\nStep 3 Cook the Ghevar\nThen take an aluminium or steel cylindrical container. Make sure that its height is at least 12″ and diameter is of 5-6″. Fill half of the container with ghee. Heat it and once the ghee is hot enough, then take a 50 ml, a glassful of the batter. Pour in centre of ghee, slowly in one continuous thread-like stream. Allow the foam to settle.\nStep 4 Cool the Ghevar and garnish with dry fruits\nAlternatively, pour some syrup evenly all over, keeping Ghevar in a mesh placed over a container. Let it cool and settle down, then top it with edible silver foil. Splash a few drops of saffron milk, sprinkle some chopped dry fruits and 1 tsp of cardamom powder. Serve it with savouries like Pakoras, Kachoris and Samosas.",

      "method": "Step 1\nTo prepare this delicious Rajasthani specialty, take a large bowl and mix together gram flour, 1 teaspoon turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon red chilli powder, salt and a pinch of asafoetida. Next, add two and a half tablespoons of ghee.\n\nStep 2\nNow, apply some ghee on your palm and knead the mixture into a firm dough using required amount of water. When done, divide the dough into equal portions and roll each portion in the form of cylindrical rolls.\n\nStep 3\nMeanwhile, put a kadhai on high flame and heat water in it. Bring it to a boil and add the besan rolls in it. Cook the rolls until they are light and soft and they start floating in water. In a similar way, cook all the remaining rolls and then, switch off the burner. Transfer them to a plate to cool lightly.\n\nStep 4\nNow, heat oil in another kadhai on medium flame and add black mustard seeds in it. Saute them until they crackle. Then, add cumin seeds and cook them until they splutter. Afterwards, add asafoetida in the oil and cook for a few seconds.\n\nStep 5\nMeanwhile, add ginger and green chilies in a blender jar and blend them into a fine paste. Add the prepared paste to the kadhai and then, add the remaining red chilli powder along with the remaining turmeric powder in the kadhai. Saute the ginger-garlic paste till the raw smell goes away.\n\nStep 6\nNow, add garam masala, coriander powder and salt as per your taste to the kadhai and stir to avoid burning the masala. Add a cup of water in the kadhai and stir well to mix with the spices. Meanwhile, beat the curd until it is soft and ensure that no lumps are formed.\n\nStep 7\nAdd curd to the kadhai and stir to incorporate the masala to the curd. Make sure that the consistency of gravy is thin and cook for about 6-7 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the besan rolls roughly into small pieces.\n\nStep 8\nWhen, the speck of oil starts to appear on the surface of gravy, add all the cut rolls into it and cook for a while. Bring it to a boil and reduce the flame. Let the rolls simmer in the gravy for 5-10 minutes.\n\nStep 9\nGatte Ki Sabzi is ready now, transfer the cooked dish to a serving bowl and serve hot with chapatis or steamed rice.",
