This might take around 10-15 minutes on medium heat.\nStep 2: Cook the Carrots\n\nOnce the carrots are soft, add milk to the pan. The quantity of milk depends on the amount of carrots you have, but a good rule of thumb is to add enough milk to just cover the carrots.\nLet the mixture simmer on low heat, stirring occasionally. Allow the carrots to cook in the milk until the milk reduces and thickens. This process could take around 30-40 minutes.\nStep 3: Sweeten and Flavor\n\nOnce the milk has reduced significantly and the carrots are cooked through, add sugar according to your taste preference. You can start with half a cup of sugar and adjust according to your sweetness preference.\nAdd cardamom powder and chopped nuts like almonds and pistachios for flavor and texture.\nStir well and continue cooking for another 10-15 minutes until the mixture thickens further and attains a halwa-like consistency.\nYour Gajar ka Halwa is now ready to be served hot or cold, garnished with more chopped nuts if desired.\nEnjoy your delicious homemade Gajar ka Halwa!",

This might take around 10-15 minutes on medium heat.\nStep 2: Cook the Carrots\n\nOnce the carrots are soft, add milk to the pan. The quantity of milk depends on the amount of carrots you have, but a good rule of thumb is to add enough milk to just cover the carrots.\nLet the mixture simmer on low heat, stirring occasionally. Allow the carrots to cook in the milk until the milk reduces and thickens. This process could take around 30-40 minutes.\nStep 3: Sweeten and Flavor\n\nOnce the milk has reduced significantly and the carrots are cooked through, add sugar according to your taste preference. You can start with half a cup of sugar and adjust according to your sweetness preference.\nAdd cardamom powder and chopped nuts like almonds and pistachios for flavor and texture.\nStir well and continue cooking for another 10-15 minutes until the mixture thickens further and attains a halwa-like consistency.\nYour Gajar ka Halwa is now ready to be served hot or cold, garnished with more chopped nuts if desired.\nEnjoy your delicious homemade Gajar ka Halwa!",
